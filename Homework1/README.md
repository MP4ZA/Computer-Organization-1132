# Assignment 1

In this assignment, the goal is to implement inline assembly in a C program to ensure the program functions correctly and performs as intended. In the C program, there are multiple asm blocks where RISC-V assembly code needs to be filled in.

## Array Sort
This program aims to implement a bubble sort algorithm, and the asm block specifically handles the swapping of elements.
<!-- ```c
``` -->

## Array Search
This program searches for a specific value in an array and returns -1 if not found. The assembly section is responsible for looping through the entire array and performing the search.
<!-- ```c
``` -->

## Linked List Sort
This program is intended to perform merge sort on a linked list. Traversing the linked list involves some pointer manipulations.

<!-- ```c
``` -->
